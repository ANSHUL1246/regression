        "\n",
        "Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. For the results to be valid and reliable, several key assumptions must be met:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Linearity**\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable should be linear. This means that changes in the predictors lead to proportional changes in the outcome. Linearity can be assessed using scatter plots or residual plots. If the relationship is nonlinear, data transformations or nonlinear modeling techniques may be necessary.&#x20;\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Multivariate Normality**\n",
        "\n",
        "The residuals (errors) of the model should be approximately normally distributed. This assumption is important for conducting valid hypothesis tests and constructing confidence intervals. Normality can be assessed using Q-Q plots or statistical tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.&#x20;\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **No Multicollinearity**\n",
        "\n",
        "Independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. High correlation among predictors, known as multicollinearity, can inflate standard errors and make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor. This can be assessed using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), where a VIF above 10 indicates significant multicollinearity.&#x20;\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Homoscedasticity**\n",
        "\n",
        "The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. If the residuals exhibit increasing or decreasing variance (heteroscedasticity), it can lead to inefficient estimates and affect the validity of statistical tests. Homoscedasticity can be checked using residual plots.&#x20;\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Independence of Errors**\n",
        "\n",
        "The residuals should be independent of each other. This means that the error associated with one observation should not influence the error of another. Violation of this assumption can occur in time series data where errors may be autocorrelated. Independence can be assessed using autocorrelation plots.&#x20;\n",

        "### 6. **Absence of Endogeneity**\n",

        " R² (R-squared) is a widely used metric to assess the goodness-of-fit in regression models. However, relying solely on R² has several limitations that can lead to misinterpretations of model performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "### ⚠️ Key Limitations of R²\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Overfitting Risk**: R² always increases or remains constant when more predictors are added to the model, even if those predictors are irrelevant. This can result in overfitting, where the model captures noise rather than the underlying data structure, leading to poor generalization to new data. ([bugfree.ai][1])\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sensitivity to Outliers**: R² is sensitive to outliers, which can disproportionately influence the model's performance assessment. A few extreme values can significantly distort the R² score, either inflating it or making it appear lower than it should be. ([fynd.academy][2])\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Assumption of Linearity**: R² assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In cases where the true relationship is nonlinear, R² may not accurately reflect the model's performance, potentially leading to misleading conclusions. ([fynd.academy][2])\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **No Information on Model Bias**: R² does not provide insight into whether the model is under-predicting or over-predicting the target variable. A high R² might still coincide with a systematically biased model, producing predictions that are consistently too high or too low. ([fynd.academy][2])\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Limited Predictive Power Assessment**: While R² indicates how well the model fits the training data, it does not directly measure the model's ability to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. A model with a high R² on training data might fail to perform well on test data. ([fynd.academy][2])\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Inappropriate for Non-Linear Models**: R² is primarily designed for linear regression models. For models that capture non-linear relationships, R² might not fully capture the model’s performance, leading researchers to seek alternative metrics. ([numberanalytics.com][3])\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Scale Dependency**: The value of R² is not scale-invariant. It can be artificially inflated when the response variable is multiplied by a constant or when additional variables, even if irrelevant, are added to the model. ([fastercapital.com][4])\n",
        "\n",
